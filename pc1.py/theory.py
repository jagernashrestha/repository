*types of machine learning 
-supervised
1.regression(for continuous data like area)
	a)linear regression
	b) multiple regression
	c)support vector machine
	d) Decision tree
	e) Random forced

2. Classification(for categorical data)
	a) logistic
	b) KNN(nearest 	neighbor )
	c)support vector machine classification
	d)decision tree classification
	e)na√Øve bayes

	

-unsupervised(color , shape ,size, clustering, k means)
-reinforcement
Methods for implementing ML algorithms:
1.interactive method (user provides feedback on the algorithm's performance)
2.batch method (algorithm is run once and then discarded)
3.online/incremental method (algorithm updates itself as new data comes in)

batch learning(deployee within  a week)
online learning(employee within an hour)

online learning(customer)within second  or minute
sklearn
